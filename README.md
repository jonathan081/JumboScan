# Engineering Notebook

## Week 2 10/9/2020
### Accomplishments:
- Determined with research which databases to use. We feel SQL should be able to be used for all DBs as long as there is not a social media aspect.
- Learned about the intracisies and regulations with using personal data.
- Leaned about the APIs from IOS and Android to use on mobile apps.

### Failures:
- We realized that making project around Tufts infrastructure wasn't viable due.
- Didn't set up AWS stack because shifted project focus to strictly mobile.
  - We will have to determine if AWS will be necessary for this

### Challenges:
- Learning which language to be used
- Figuring out other use cases

### Goals for Next Week:
- Redesign user experience of JumboScan to fit a wider scope
      - This will include a change of the name
- Learn Android exposure API and choose which to move foward with (ios/android)
      - This decision will be made early next week
    

### Key Decisions to be Made:
- Android vs Ios
- Will there be an added purpose/use to the app
    - Social media
    - Game
    - Some reason for people to use the app besides tracing.
