# Engineering Notebook

## Week 2 10/9/2020
### Accomplishments:
- Determined with research which databases to use. We feel SQL should be able to be used for all DBs as long as there is not a social media aspect.
- Learned about the intracisies and regulations with using personal data.
- Learned about the APIs from IOS and Android to use on mobile apps.
### Failures:
- We realized that making project around Tufts infrastructure wasn't viable due to time constraints and dealing with university administration.
- Didn't set up AWS stack because shifted project focus to strictly mobile.
  - We will have to determine if AWS will be necessary for this
### Challenges:
- Learning which language to be used
- Figuring out other use cases
- Determining how much data we must store to use Android/Apple exposure APIs
### Goals for Next Week:
- Redesign user experience of JumboScan to fit a wider scope
      - This will include a change of the name
- Learn Android exposure API and choose which to move foward with (ios/android)
      - This decision will be made early next week
- Start experimenting with mobile app development.
      - Create a "hello world" starter app to get started on each smartphone platform.
### Key Decisions to be Made:
- Android vs iOS
- A new name for the project
- Will there be an added purpose/use outside of contact tracing?
    - Social media
    - Game
    - Incentive for people to use the app besides tracing.
- What backend infrastructure (if any) will we need?
